issues with engine:
* mesh seg fault when no normal
* mesh_parse_from_obj kinda ugly. should also have option for procedural mesh
* should be able to parse assets directly from directory
Assets: obj -> mesh, png -> texture, scene -> Scene

what if camera dimensions don't match framebuffer dimension

protect library against user (null checks at interface)

optional App abstraction but can use main file directly if you want

document API clearly + example usage

ability to save scene

if texture is null, print something to the console

implement a depth pre-pass so the frag shader isnt run on frags that arent gonna be visible
